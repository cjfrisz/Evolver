I apologize in advance for anyone trying to use or contribute to this
project. At current, it's a single wolf (myself, Chris Frisz
(cjfrisz@chrisfrisz.com)) tryingt to design a 2D game engine without
reading about how other people design games in C++. I'm simply trying
to address each design problem as quickly as possible using OOP design
patterns. That said, the master branch should compile, even if the
resulting executable doesn't do much interesting. The include makefile
is fairly self-explanatory, but here's a list of the notable rules:

all: 
     Compiles all execuateable, evolver, along with the necessary
     classes.

run:
	Compiles the executeable and run it.

clean:
	Delete all ancilliary files (emacs backups, core dumps, etc.)
	and object files

clobber:
	Delete all ancilliary files and compiled files (object files
	and executeable)
